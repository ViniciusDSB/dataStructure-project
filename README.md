We are making a project of data structer (teacher request)

This is suposed to be a system where we can input a path witha bunch of PDFs
The system reads the tetx in the files and produce a bunch of plain text (.txt)
Then it compresses the plain text we should be able to use a hash table to seach words

After that we have to make a report with an analysis of the perfomance of the code
